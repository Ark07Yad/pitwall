**A live Formula 1 race strategy engine.**

Pitwall consumes Formula 1's live timing stream, fits tyre degradation and safety-car models
in-session, and simulates the remainder of the race to answer one question: **should we pit now?**

Every recommendation is committed to this repository with a timestamp *before* the lap it refers
to. The accuracy log is public and includes the calls it got wrong.

> **Status: Phase 1 of 5.** The feed abstraction, replay harness and race-state reducer are built
> and tested. Models, simulation and the live parser are next — see [the plan](docs/PLAN.md).

## Why this exists

Most public F1 projects predict *outcomes* from historical data after the fact. A pit wall does
something harder: it makes *decisions* in real time, under uncertainty, against rivals who react.
Pitwall is built around that difference.

| | Typical F1 repo | Pitwall |
|---|---|---|
| Timing | Offline, post-race | Real-time, under a latency budget |
| Output | "Who will win?" | "Pit now, or lap +3?" |
| Rivals | Assumed static | Modelled as reactive agents |
| Validation | Often none | Pre-registered calls, scored on calibration |

## Quickstart

Requires Python 3.11+. [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) handles the interpreter for you.

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
uv run pytest
```

### Record a live session

Run this ~5 minutes before a session starts. It supervises the connection and reconnects, because
F1's feed reliably drops after about two hours — roughly the length of a Grand Prix.

```bash
uv run python scripts/record.py data/raw/2026-hungary-race.txt
```

It is safe to start early: a connection made outside a session returns one state snapshot and then
nothing, and the supervisor detects that and backs off to five-minute retries rather than
reconnecting in a loop.

### Record unattended

Races happen at awkward times. This waits for the session, holds off system sleep, records, and
stops on its own:

```bash
nohup ./scripts/scheduled_record.sh "2026-07-26 13:30" data/raw/2026-hungary-race.txt 210 &
```

Arguments are start time (local), output file, and minutes to record. Progress goes to
`data/raw/<name>-runner.log`.

**Leave the machine plugged in, on wi-fi, and with the lid open.** macOS sleeps on lid close
regardless of `caffeinate`, and a sleeping Mac records nothing.

### Replay one

```bash
uv run pitwall topics data/raw/2026-hungary-race.txt      # what's in the recording
uv run pitwall replay data/raw/2026-hungary-race.txt      # fold it into race state
uv run pitwall replay data/raw/2026-hungary-race.txt --speed 60 --follow
```

`--speed 60` replays a two-hour race in about two minutes with a live timing screen.

## Architecture

```
RaceFeed  ──►  RaceStateReducer  ──►  Models  ──►  Simulation  ──►  Decision
(ingest)       (fold events)         (fit)        (Monte Carlo)    (pit or stay)
```

**Two design rules carry the whole system:**

1. **Everything is a `RaceFeed`.** Live websocket, recorded file, REST API — nothing downstream
   knows which. This is what lets the same code be developed offline and run live.
2. **State is only ever produced by folding events.** No model, heuristic, or UI callback writes
   to it. Given the same recording the reducer produces byte-identical state every time, which is
   what makes replay-based regression tests — and the backtest — trustworthy.

### Layout

```
src/pitwall/
├── feed/
│   ├── base.py       RaceFeed ABC, FeedEvent, .z inflation
│   └── replay.py     ReplayFeed — the development workhorse
└── state/
    ├── merge.py      delta merging (the most safety-critical code here)
    ├── models.py     typed projections: RaceState, CarState, Stint
    └── reducer.py    folds events into state
scripts/record.py     supervised live recorder
docs/PLAN.md          the full five-phase plan
```

### Two details worth knowing

**The feed sends deltas, not snapshots.** After the initial dump, `{"Lines": {"4": {"Position":
"3"}}}` means "car 4 moved to P3" — not "the timing table now contains only car 4". Overwriting
instead of merging doesn't crash; it silently drops state and still renders a plausible-looking
screen. `state/merge.py` handles this, including the feed's habit of patching arrays with
index-keyed objects, and it's the most heavily tested module in the repo.

**Recorded lines are Python reprs, not JSON.** The common approach is to convert them by replacing
`'` with `"`, which corrupts any payload containing an apostrophe — race control messages routinely
contain them. Pitwall uses `ast.literal_eval`, which parses Python literals natively and safely.
There's a regression test for exactly this.

## Disclaimer

Unofficial and unaffiliated with Formula 1. It uses F1's public live timing endpoint the same way
open-source clients like FastF1 and f1-dash do: one connection, no redistribution of the raw feed,
non-commercial use only. Jolpica is volunteer-funded — its responses are cached rather than polled.
